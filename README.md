# G25 project

This is a experimental project for learning purposes -- a.e.: it's not meant to be finished or well-coded in anyways. If it comes to become a real application, then this text will be, for sure, changed.

## Building

```bash

 > mkdir build && build
 > ../build.sh && ./out

```

And then open the local address http://localhost:4242 in your browser.

## TODO list

 - [ ] Switch from shell scripts to makefiles, if necessary;
 - [ ] Write a better README file;
 - [ ] ;
