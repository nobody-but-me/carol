# Carol project

Carol is meant to be an all-in-one single-binary static website generator for Razomentalist, my new project of personal website. This is an experimental project for learning purposes -- i.e.: it's not meant to be finished or well-coded in anyways. If it comes to become a real application, then this text will be, for sure, changed.

I don't even know if the current application can be named a "static website generator."

## Building

```bash

 > chmod +x ./build.sh ./run.sh
 > ./build.sh

```

And follow the messages. So then, open the local address http://localhost:4242 in your browser.
