# Execurator project

Execurator is meant to be an all-in-one single-binary static website generator for Razomentalist, my new project of personal website. This is an experimental project for learning purposes -- i.e.: it's not meant to be finished or well-coded in anyways. If it comes to become a real application, then this text will be, for sure, changed.

## Building

```bash

 > ./build.sh

And then open the local address http://localhost:4242 in your browser.
